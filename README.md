MazeCoder Capstone Project Document
🧠 Idea Brief
Project Name: MazeCoder
Domain/Interest Area: Game-based Learning + Web Development.

Description:
MazeCoder is an interactive quiz-based maze game that helps learners improve their coding knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions. The quiz is divided into levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard. For every correct answer, the player progresses one step forward in the maze. Once all questions are answered, the maze either celebrates success (if all are correct) or shows completion with the score.
Why this project?
This idea combines my interests in frontend development, backend systems, and game mechanics. It is also a unique, interactive way to test coding concepts in a visually engaging way.
